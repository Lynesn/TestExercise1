JavaScript test

1.Modify the Registration system to take in three inputs. ‘username’, ‘password’, ‘confirm
password’.
• Make sure the password and confirm password are the same. If not please alert
the user to change the password or the confirm password.
• Save the provided username and password in the local storage.
• When the user provides the correct validated username and password, redirect
them to the login page.

2. From the Registration system we made., Create a simple login system.
• The user should provide username and a password that has to be validated.
• The provided username and password should already exist in the local storage.
• If the user provides a username that does not exist in the local storage, alert them
‘user does not exist’.
• When the provided email and password exist, alert them a successful login and
redirect them to a page with their saying welcome ‘username’
